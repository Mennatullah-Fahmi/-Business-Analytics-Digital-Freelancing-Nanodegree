The program focused on developing skills in data analysis, reporting, and freelancing strategies, with an emphasis on answering critical business questions and creating actionable insights.

## What I Learned

Throughout the nanodegree, I gained hands-on experience in:
- **Data Analysis and Reporting**: Analyzing datasets, interpreting results, and creating structured reports to answer business questions.
- **Freelancing Skills**: Understanding the fundamentals of freelancing, including client communication, project management, and delivering high-quality work.
- **Task Management**: Breaking down tasks, setting priorities, and ensuring timely completion of assignments.
- **Critical Thinking**: Developing the ability to ask the right questions and provide data-driven answers to solve business problems.

## Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: [Tableau Dashboard Exploration]**
   - In this project, I explored a Tableau dashboard to practice interpreting data visualizations and effectively communicating insights. The goal was to select one dashboard from a provided list, analyze the data, and derive three meaningful insights. I captured screenshots of the visualizations, documented my observations, and compiled a concise 1-2 page report explaining how I reached each conclusion.
   
        **Dashboard Chosen**: [Malaria in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true)

        **Key Skills Demonstrated**
        - Data Interpretation: Analyzing visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
        - Insight Communication: Clearly articulating findings and supporting them with evidence from the dashboard.
        - Report Writing: Structuring a professional report with visual aids and concise explanations.

2. **Project 2: [Analyze NYSE Data]**
   - In this project, I analyzed real-world financial data from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) using a cleaned subset of Kaggle's S&P 500 dataset.
   -  The dataset included historical financial data from 448 companies, focusing on fundamental metrics from SEC 10K filings and sector classifications. The goal was to calculate summary statistics, derive business insights, and create visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
     
    **Dataset Used**:[ Fundamentals.csv: Financial data from SEC 10K annual filings](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/October/5bc0f2d2_projectdata-nyse/projectdata-nyse.csv).
   
    **Key Skills Demonstrated**:
      - Data Analysis: Calculating measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
      - Spreadsheet Proficiency: Using advanced Excel/Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, OFFSET).
      - Business Metrics Forecasting: Analyzing and forecasting financial metrics to predict future growth prospects.
      - Data Visualization: Creating charts and dashboards to present insights clearly.
    
    **Project Deliverables**
      - Part One: Familiarization with the dataset through 8 quiz questions (not submitted for review).
      - Part Two:
         - [A spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets)](projectdata-nyse/projectdata-nyse.xlsx) containing calculations, summary statistics, and a profit-and-loss dashboard.
         - [A presentation (PDF or PowerPoint)](projectdata-nyse/project-submission.pptx) summarizing key findings, visualizations, and forecast scenarios.
