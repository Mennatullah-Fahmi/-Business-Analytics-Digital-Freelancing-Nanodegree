The program focused on developing skills in data analysis, reporting, and freelancing strategies, with an emphasis on answering critical business questions and creating actionable insights.

## What I Learned

Throughout the nanodegree, I gained hands-on experience in:
- **Data Analysis and Reporting**: Analyzing datasets, interpreting results, and creating structured reports to answer business questions.
- **Freelancing Skills**: Understanding the fundamentals of freelancing, including client communication, project management, and delivering high-quality work.
- **Task Management**: Breaking down tasks, setting priorities, and ensuring timely completion of assignments.
- **Critical Thinking**: Developing the ability to ask the right questions and provide data-driven answers to solve business problems.

## Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: [Tableau Dashboard Exploration]**
   - In this project, I explored a Tableau dashboard to practice interpreting data visualizations and effectively communicating insights. The goal was to select one dashboard from a provided list, analyze the data, and derive three meaningful insights. I captured screenshots of the visualizations, documented my observations, and compiled a concise 1-2 page report explaining how I reached each conclusion.
   
        **Dashboard Chosen**: [Malaria in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true)
